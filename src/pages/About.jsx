            <li>This was coded while using a Meta Quest 2 in VR via the Immersed application</li>
            <li>Will I feel tired after some time coding in VR? It is possible. The lenses are not exactly great, you can sense some lag or delay between the
                computer and the monitors on the VR. The annoying thing is the fact that only the focal point where you are looking at is clear, the 
                rest is kind of rendered blurry. I am not sure if this is a limitation of the Quest 2 or the Immersed application. I will have to try
                with other applications to see if the same happens. I really want to be working in VR because of the perks of having three huge monitors
                around me. I am not sure if I will be able to work for long periods of time in VR, but I will try. I will be updating this section as I
                get more experience working in VR.
                Actually my roommate is very kind and he let me use his Oculus Quest 2. 
                I mean I still think I'd have to get used to it, but I think it is a great tool for productivity.
                Also, tweaking interpupillary distance is a must and will help in making the experience better overall.
                Apparently it is also demanding on the battery which would be something to consider. I've only used it for
                about an hour and it drained almost half of my battery.
                It's so cool though and I feel like I'm already getting used to it.
                The quality is not that of a monitor, it's kind of bad, but at the same time I don't feel like it's a DEAL-BREAKER which sounds weird.
                My eyes are kind of starting to feel weird now and I'm maybe starting to have some kind of headache, I don't know.
                Something that could change after some time getting used to it though. It's 11:09 PM now and I started using it at 9:45 PM.
                The passthrough is NOT great, can't read the symbols. Luckily I know how to touch type.
                The strap as I had didn't help as well, I needed to losen it up a bit
                Overall it feels like a beta tester experience, but it's doable. I think I could get used to it.
                Maybe not replace entirly working with a monitor, but slowly starting to.
                Is it good for my eyesight? Who knows. It's soooo cool though wow.
                Definitly gotta get used to it, but OMG once you do I can see how it can boost your productivity sooooo much.
                A new way of experiencing coding for sure so cool.
